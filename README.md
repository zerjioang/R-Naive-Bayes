#R Naive Bayes

This project describes the implementation of a Naive Bayes algorithm using R language for an inteligent model creation based on best attribute selection.

This attribute selection is done, selecting a random attribute along population, building the model using that attribute and checking the accuracy of the model with previous one. The process is done, when no improvements on the model are detected.
